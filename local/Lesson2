How to create a  branch in github:
1. Go to your github and clone your repo (I am using gitbash)
2. ls (you can see the repo now)
3. cd (reponame)
4. git checkout -b test (test is the new branch name)
5. you are switched inside test now do ls (we can see that we have a readme.md file inside test
6. vi newfile1
7. ls
8. git add .
9. git commit -m "leraning to branch"
10. git push ( a message will come saying the current branch test has no upstream branch)

11. git push --set-upstream origin test
12. git branch (you will now see main and test as your output
13. git checkout main (switched to branch main)
14. ls
