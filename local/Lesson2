## How to create a  branch in github:
1. Go to your github and clone your repo (I am using gitbash)
2. ls (you can see the repo now)
3. cd (reponame)
4. git checkout -b test (test is the new branch name)
5. you are switched inside test now do ls (we can see that we have a readme.md file inside test
6. vi newfile1
7. ls
8. git add .
9. git commit -m "leraning to branch"
10. git push ( a message will come saying the current branch test has no upstream branch)

11. git push --set-upstream origin test
12. git branch (you will now see main and test as your output
13. git checkout main (switched to branch main)
14. ls

To access your github from your terminal:
use ssh option and if you don't have ssh key you can generate
a key by the following command
go to your ssh folder in your terminal 
cd ~/.ssh

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C" GitSSHKey"
ls
cat githubkey.pub
chmod 400 githubkey

ssh -add -l


error ssh agent is not active then you can mention the following
command


We need to active the agent.
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" > Agent pid 59566

eval `ssh-agent`
^^
few important git commands:
git branch -a to keep a track of branch and main
git push -u origin dev

git rebase (when you want to add changes on top of everyone else's change in repo)
